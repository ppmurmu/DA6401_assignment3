## ðŸŽ¯ About the assignment
The goal is to build a model that takes a romanized string as input (e.g., "ghar") and produces the corresponding word in Devanagari (e.g., "à¤˜à¤°").

## ðŸ§¬ About the dataset
We use the Dakshina dataset provided by Google Research, which contains word pairs in the following format:
Latin script (romanized version)
Native script (Devanagari or other Indian scripts)
